<h1>Tic Tac Toe</h1> :Tic tac toe is X’s and O’s is a paper and pencil game for two players X and O, who take turns marking the spaces in a 3×3 grid.Minimax can be implemented using a recursive or backtracking algorithm which traverses a game tree consisting of possible moves and their outcomes.
Tic tac toe is X’s and O’s is a paper and pencil game for two players X and O, who take turns marking the spaces in a 3×3 grid.
Win condition:In order to win the game ,a player(computer or human) must place three of their marks in horizontal or vertical or diagonal.
Draw Condition:If the both players (computer and human) do not meet any condition of win like 3 place horizontal , vertical,diagonal.
Minimax:
Minimax can be implemented using a recursive or backtracking algorithm which traverses a game tree consisting of possible moves and their outcomes. The root node of the tree represents the current game state. Each branch from a node represents a possible move a player could make. Each child node represents the resulting game state of a possible move.
